# bodgeit
*The BodgeIt Store* is a vulnerable web application for newcomers to pen-testing automation. 
See [Security Regression Tests with ZAProxy - Demo Setup](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/RegTestsDemo) 
to get an idea of this project applications. Please keep in mind that that page is thin on detail and some bits 
from the [old project page](https://code.google.com/p/bodgeit/) are missing:
* list of vulnerabilities
* a Scoring page at bodgeit/score.jsp ("About Us") with 14 challenges

This project shows a case for automatic testing in the 1st place. 
When one is in need of just an intentionally vulnerable app he or she may be better served elsewhere. 
E.g. see 
[OWASP WebGoat](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project), 
[OWASP Vicnum Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Vicnum_Project), or 
[Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop).

Please also note that there were attempts to mavenize this project, [the original one](https://github.com/ddt-tdd/bodgeit-maven) and this [one](https://github.com/AlbanAndrieu/bodgeit-maven)
