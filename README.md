# bodgeit
*The BodgeIt Store* is a vulnerable web application for newcomers to pen-testing automation. 
See [Security Regression Tests with ZAProxy - Demo Setup](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/RegTestsDemo) 
to get an idea of this project applications.

This project shows a case for automatic testing in the 1st place. 
When one is in need of just an intentionally vulnerable app he or she may be better served elsewhere.
