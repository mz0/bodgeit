# bodgeit
"BodgeIt Store" is a vulnerable web application for newcomers to pen-testing. 
See [Security Regression Tests with ZAProxy - Demo Setup](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/RegTestsDemo) to get an idea of this app applications.

This project shows a case for automatic testing in the 1st place. When one is need of just an intentionally vulnerable app he may be better served elsewhere.
