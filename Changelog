- ant build failure in absence of build/WEB-INF/classes. See 'how-i-did-ant' for log and TODO
- added build/WEB-INF/claases temporarily until above TODO is not resolved 
- And a whole buch of excludes to '.gitignore'. When TODO is finished 
  we should remove them as well as WEB-INF/classes and ignore the whole build/

- .gitignore cleaned up
- small meta-doc fixes

- added 'mkdir build/tests' to 'build' target to cater for 'test' target 
- (currently 'ant test' fails. Logs are in build/tests)
-'test' should depend on 'build'; 'test' should show in 'ant -p' - added 'description'
- added .project to simplify importing Git folder into Eclipse
- 'ant 'test' warns of multiple 'ant.jar' found. 'git rm lib/ant.jar'

- suspecting missing junit.jar and ant-junit.jar the causes of failng 'ant test'
- a cryptic URLClassLoader ClassNotFound exception may mean it (in build/tests/TEST-*)
- apt-get install junit did not help
- looking closer at 'SeleneseTestCase' deprecation warning
- added 'projectSet.psf' to check project import on some other machine
- corrected probable typo in build.xml and turned on 'javac' debugging info in desperation
