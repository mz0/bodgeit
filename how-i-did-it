Different git Push & Pull(fetch) URLs
-------------------------------------
Ok, now this seems to be very easy and very useful technique while forking someones repo, but I always spend a lot of time searching how to do it.
When you're forking someone's repo to add some features to it, you want to pull(fetch) from a main repository and push into your's (forked one). Now git gives you this option from the box.

git remote -v

origin git@github.com:User/forked.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:User/forked.git (push)

As you can see the remote origin has 2 urls, one with fetch label and one with push. This means that you can fetch and push to different urls while using the same remote.

Now how to do it:
First of all you need to set the remotes url to the one of main repository (the one you forked from):
git remote set-url origin git://github.com/chief/global.git

Then you set the push url of that remote to your's (forked) repo: 
git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:User/forked.git

Yeah, it's weird that you can't set the different pull url by itself, just a push one. Anyways, now we have our awesome remote config:

git remote -v
origin git://github.com/chief/global.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:User/forked.git (push)

There is also a shorter way to do this.

You can edit a .git/config file. When you'll first open it (whiteout making all the remotes dance described above) you should see something like this:

...
[remote "origin"]
 fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
 url = git@github.com:User/forked.git
...

Now all you have to do is change url to value to the repo you've forked from, and add a pushurl variable with the value of your's repo. You'r config with now look like this:

...
[remote "origin"]
 fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
 url = git://github.com/chief/global.git
 pushurl = git@github.com:User/forked.git
...

That's all. From now on all your pull/fetch requests to origin will get the latest updates from the main repository and all push requests to origin will update your forked repository. Happy forking!
